# FIREWALL RULE: Allow RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
# -------------------------------------------------

# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This opens RDP to the entire internet (0.0.0.0/0) ‚Äî very insecure for production!

    ports    = ["3389"]     # Port 3389 is the standard RDP port

  # This rule only applies to instances explicitly tagged with "allow-rdp"
  # Firewall rules in GCP are tag-based (unlike AWS security groups which bind directly to instances).
